# Description

This project is a pomodoro timer with a built in white noise player which saves the hassle of opening a pomodoro website and a youtube player.

## After cloning:

### `Run npm install`

### `Run npm start`

This project is still under work, so there might be unfunctional buttons or bugs in the audio player.
