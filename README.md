## After cloning:

- Run npm install.
- Run npm start.

## Known Bugs:

- When the timer is left in the background and is no longer an active tab in Chrome, a slight slowdown is noticed when compared to a real timer (~ 10 sec.)
- In Firefox, the volume bar does not work and it may be due to autoplay policy in Firefox. To be fixed.
